| **Study Title**            | Creation and Evaluation of XX Across Different Database Sources                                                           |
| **Study Status**           | Study Status: Started                                                                                                                             |
| **Next Steps**             | Generate the 8 phenotypes on multiple external OMOP CDMs (at least 1 claims and 1 EHR based CDMs) and run Phevaluator on external CDMs            |
| **Research Question**      | How do XXX phenotypes perform across different data sources (EHR, claims, registries) that may have differences in how the OMOP ETL was performed? |
| **Uncertainty**            | We remain uncertain as to how our phenotypes will perform across other database types (claims, other EHR, etc).                                    |
| **Study type**             | Clinical Application.                                                                                                                             |
